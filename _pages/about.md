SELECTED RESEARCH EXPERIENCES
------
**Migration and transformation of DOM in the Erhai Lake and its impact on COD**  
Master’s degree research project, supervised by Prof. Wang Xinze, 2020/7-2021/12  	
  * Conducted one-year water sample testing at 155 sampling points (Yunnan Province)
  * **Major Contribution**: Quantified the contribution of different sources to DOM, based on the Partial Least Square-Path Model (PLS-PM). Realized the prediction of COD through the Machine learning (Random forest and Ridge regression)
  * **Output**: Master thesis(in progress), 2 first-authored publications & 1 first-authored publication(in Chinese)

**Fluorescence characteristics and source analysis of DOM in Danjiangkou Reservoir**  
Bachelor’s degree research project, supervised by Prof. Li Ming, 2018/5-2019/5  
  * Performed excitation emission matrix–parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) on 360 water samples (Hubei Province & Henan Province), analyzed temporal and spatial variation of DOM and traced DOM’s main sources  
  * **Output**: Bachelor thesis (Rated as excellent)  

**Effect of Water and Fertilizer Coupling on Vegetation Growth in Arid Desert Area**  
Undergraduate research project, supervised by Prof. Wang Jinxin, 2017/5-2018/5
